# Smart Garbage Management System

An **IoT-driven solution** designed for municipal corporations to optimize waste collection. The system monitors garbage bin levels, stores data in a centralized database, and provides garbage trucks with prioritized routes to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure cleaner cities.

## Features
- Real-time garbage bin monitoring using IoT sensors.
- Centralized database for storing bin fill levels.
- Smart routing for garbage trucks to prioritize high-fill bins.
- Enhanced efficiency and reduced operational costs.

## Benefits
- Cleaner cities through optimized waste collection.
- Efficient Waste collection  system.
- Cost-effective operations for municipal corporations.
- Reduced fuel consumption and manual effort.

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: IoT sensors for real-time monitoring.
- **Backend**: Database for data storage and analysis.
- **Frontend**: Dashboard for route prioritization and data visualization.

## How It Works
1. IoT sensors detect garbage levels in bins.
2. Data is sent to a centralized database.
3. Garbage trucks receive prioritized routes based on bin fill levels.
4. Routes are optimized for efficiency and fuel savings.
