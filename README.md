Smart Garbage Management System
Project Description
The Smart Garbage Management System is an innovative solution designed to help municipal corporations improve waste collection efficiency. The system monitors the fill levels of garbage bins using IoT sensors and sends this data to a centralized database. This information is then shared with garbage collection trucks, enabling them to prioritize pickups based on bin status. The goal is to optimize waste management, reduce operational costs, and contribute to cleaner cities.

Features
Bin Monitoring: Real-time tracking of garbage levels in bins using IoT sensors.
Data Storage: Stores bin status and location data in a centralized database for analysis.
Geolocation Integration: Associates bins with their precise geolocations for easy identification.
Efficient Route Planning: Provides garbage trucks with optimized routes based on bin fill levels.
Priority Notifications: Alerts drivers to high-priority bins to ensure timely waste collection.
Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard for city authorities to view bin statuses and manage operations.
Technologies Used
IoT Sensors: For real-time monitoring of garbage levels.
Database: Centralized storage for bin status and geolocation data (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).
Backend: To process and manage bin data (e.g., Node.js, Python).
Frontend/Dashboard: For visualizing bin data and analytics (e.g., React.js, Next.js).
Geolocation APIs: For mapping and navigation (e.g., Google Maps API).
Communication: Notification system for garbage truck drivers (e.g., SMS/Push Notifications).
How It Works
IoT sensors installed in garbage bins detect the fill levels.
Sensor data is sent to a central server and stored in a database.
The system analyzes the data and sends optimized pickup routes to garbage truck drivers.
The municipal corporation monitors bin statuses and collection activities via a dashboard.
